     - Management of user accounts, including customers and owners.
     - Access to an admin dashboard that provides statistical data and system insights for better decision-making.

**Project Requirements:**

- Technology Stack: The application is developed using Spring Boot, which facilitates the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that can run independently.
- Database Integration: Utilize a relational database management system for storing and retrieving data efficiently, ensuring data integrity and security.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and accessible on various devices, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
- Security Features: Implement robust security measures, including encrypted passwords, secure endpoints, and compliance with data protection regulations to protect user data.

**Goals:**
The primary goal of this system is to streamline the process of property management for all stakeholders involved, from property viewing to offer management. 
It aims to provide a seamless, intuitive user experience while ensuring data accuracy and security.
This project will cater to the needs of real estate markets, potentially scaling to accommodate varying types of properties and transaction models.
It is ideal for property management companies, real estate agencies, and independent property owners looking to digitize their operations.
